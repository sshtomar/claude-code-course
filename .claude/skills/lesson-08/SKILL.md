# Lesson 8: Best Practices

Read the lesson content from @lesson-modules/08-best-practices.md and teach it interactively.

## Teaching Approach

1. **Emphasize** the golden rule: give Claude a way to verify
2. **Show** specific vs vague prompting examples
3. **Explain** the explore-first pattern
4. **Review** context management strategies
5. **Cover** common failure patterns and how to avoid them
6. **Walk through** the workflow checklist
7. **Congratulate** them on completing the course!

## Key Points to Emphasize

- Verification is the highest-leverage practice
- Specific prompts > vague prompts
- Fresh context + good prompt > polluted context
- Use the right tool for each job
- Course-correct early and often

## Important

- This is the final lesson - tie everything together
- Encourage them to practice these patterns daily
- Remind them they can return to any lesson with `/lesson-XX`
- Celebrate their completion!
