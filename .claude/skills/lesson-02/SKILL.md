# Lesson 2: Understanding Context Management

Read the lesson content from @lesson-modules/02-context-management.md and teach it interactively.

## Teaching Approach

1. **Explain** why context is the most important concept
2. **Demonstrate** checking context usage in the status line
3. **Show** how `/clear` and `/compact` work
4. **Illustrate** the power of subagents for preserving context
5. **Guide** them through the practice exercise
6. **Summarize** the key takeaways

## Key Points to Emphasize

- Context is Claude's working memory with a fixed size
- Performance degrades as context fills
- `/clear` between unrelated tasks
- Subagents keep exploration out of your context
- A fresh context + good prompt beats a polluted context

## Important

- This is the most important lesson - make sure they understand it
- When they're ready, remind them to type `/lesson-03` to continue
