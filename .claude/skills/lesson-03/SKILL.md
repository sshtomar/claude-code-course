# Lesson 3: CLAUDE.md - Persistent Memory

Read the lesson content from @lesson-modules/03-claude-md.md and teach it interactively.

## Teaching Approach

1. **Explain** what CLAUDE.md is and why it matters
2. **Show** the different locations and their purposes
3. **Demonstrate** creating a CLAUDE.md with `/init`
4. **Guide** them in writing effective instructions
5. **Explain** imports and modular rules
6. **Summarize** the key takeaways

## Key Points to Emphasize

- CLAUDE.md is for things Claude can't infer from code
- Keep it short - long = ignored
- Use specific, actionable instructions
- Organize large projects with `.claude/rules/`
- Test your rules by asking about them

## Important

- Encourage them to run `/init` and customize the result
- When they're ready, remind them to type `/lesson-04` to continue
