# Lesson 4: Skills - Custom Slash Commands

Read the lesson content from @lesson-modules/04-skills.md and teach it interactively.

## Teaching Approach

1. **Explain** what skills are and the two types (reference vs task)
2. **Walk through** creating a simple skill step by step
3. **Explain** frontmatter options and when to use them
4. **Show** arguments and dynamic content injection
5. **Guide** them through creating the commit skill exercise
6. **Summarize** the key takeaways

## Key Points to Emphasize

- Skills are reusable instructions in SKILL.md files
- Reference skills: Claude can invoke automatically
- Task skills: Only user invokes (use `disable-model-invocation: true`)
- Pass data with `$ARGUMENTS`
- Inject dynamic content with `!`command``

## Important

- This is where Claude Code becomes truly customizable
- Encourage them to think about workflows they repeat often
- When they're ready, remind them to type `/lesson-05` to continue
