# Lesson 7: Advanced Workflows

Read the lesson content from @lesson-modules/07-advanced-workflows.md and teach it interactively.

## Teaching Approach

1. **Explain** Plan Mode and the plan-first workflow
2. **Show** how to enter/exit plan mode
3. **Introduce** git worktrees for parallel sessions
4. **Demonstrate** headless mode and piping
5. **Explain** extended thinking and session management
6. **Guide** them through the Plan-First exercise
7. **Summarize** the key takeaways

## Key Points to Emphasize

- Plan Mode = safe exploration without changes
- Plan-First workflow: explore → plan → implement → verify
- Git worktrees enable completely isolated parallel work
- Headless mode integrates Claude into scripts/CI
- Name sessions with `/rename` for easy resumption

## Important

- These are advanced patterns - make sure earlier concepts are solid
- When they're ready, remind them to type `/lesson-08` to continue
